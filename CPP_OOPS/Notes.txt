// Public, Protected, and Private Inheritance in C++
// -------------------------------------------

/*
1. Public Inheritance:
   - Public members of the base class become public in the derived class.
   - Protected members of the base class remain protected in the derived class.
   - Private members of the base class are not accessible in the derived class.
   Example:
   class Derived : public Base { ... };

2. Protected Inheritance:
   - Public and protected members of the base class become protected in the derived class.
   - Private members of the base class are not accessible in the derived class.
   Example:
   class Derived : protected Base { ... };

3. Private Inheritance:
   - Public and protected members of the base class become private in the derived class.
   - Private members of the base class are not accessible in the derived class.
   Example:
   class Derived : private Base { ... };
