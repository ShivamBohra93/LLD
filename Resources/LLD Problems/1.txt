Note: This is based on my personal experience. I am not claiming that these exact problems will be asked. However, studying these resources will help. 

P.S: I’ve been getting 10+ queries regarding DSA, HLD, and LLD daily

So, to answer all, I’ve launched my One Stop Resource guide for aspiring software engineers.

This guide help you with:
- full roadmap of DSA, HLD, and LLD for interviews
- good resources that I used included to save you time
- lots of problems and case studies for DSA and system design
